# Ankhorage UI

## Quickstart

Setup Ankhorage CMS and provide a `./config.ts`. If this file is not found a default configuration will be used, which is recommended if you're new.

`ankh-ui` will be copied to `./next/src/app/_uis/` during the initialization phase.

```bash
pnpm dlx ankh-cms@latest
```

You can also just install the UI framework and e.g. start storybook:

```bash
pnpm add ankh-ui
pnpm run storybook
```

## Auth Roles

This chapter may change very soon, it's a first approach to separate user (read-only) and CMS admin.

In `lib/auth/Auth.tsx` replace the `tmpRoleDefinition` by serverside evaluated roles.

‚ö†Ô∏è For demo purposes everyone is granted CMS admin atm.

- Auth.ReadRole: Default role to get view privilegues.
- Auth.WriteRole: Admin role to modify the webapp (CMS)
