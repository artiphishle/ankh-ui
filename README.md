# Ankhorage UI

React.js UI library

## Quickstart

### Ankhorage CMS

This will setup a Next.js app with generated pages (from a config file) and `ankh-ui` is the used UI framework.

```bash
pnpm dlx ankh-cms@latest
```

### Storybook

You could also just clone this repository and start the storybook to see the components in action.

```bash
pnpm run sb
```
